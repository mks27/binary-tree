# binary-tree

this project is based on binary tree. in this project i am implementing some operation on binary tree using c++ programming language.
these operations are:
1)inserting a node in binary tree
2)for pre order traversal
3)for in order traversal
4)for post order traversal
5)find height of tree
6)breadth first traversal
7)cloning and delete original tree
8)in order traversal without recursion
9)count no. of nodes in tree

in this program i am using class concepts, and the program is menu driven.
